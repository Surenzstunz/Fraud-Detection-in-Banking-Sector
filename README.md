Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning and Blochain Technique

This study proposes a novel approach for credit card fraud detection using the AutoXGBoost machine learning algorithm and blockchain technique. The AutoXGBoost algorithm is applied to the dataset to accurately detect fraudulent transactions, and the blockchain technique is used to ensure the security and immutability of the transaction records. The proposed approach shows promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it a potential solution for credit card fraud detection in the future.
